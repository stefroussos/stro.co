Unfortunately most people struggle to understand the technology that drives it. This is a non-technical guide that unravels Bitcoinâ€™s core concepts by using real-time data and interactive visualisations. I used [Airbnb's Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) for the animations, [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) for the web app and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Firestore & Functions to get real-time Bitcoin data.",
