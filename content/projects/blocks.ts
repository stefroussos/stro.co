  description: "[Blocks](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2106691934/blocks-the-worlds-first-modular-smartwatch) was a UK startup creating the worldâ€™s first modular smartwatch. As Digital Design Lead, I was responsible for the software design and visual identity of the company while simultaneously supporting the industrial and marketing teams.
