  description: "[Leap AD](http://communitybydesign.co.uk/) is a company based in London producing small or ‘micro' scale [anaerobic digesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_digestion) for urban environments. They commissioned a project for product design students in their final year at Central Saint Martins to design products and services around their prototype digester. I participated in the project and early on decided to avoid the conventional waste & recycling route and go down a more unorthodox path; death. The dramatic rise of burial costs (90% in 10 years - [Sunlife](https://www.sunlife.co.uk/press-office/cost-of-dying-2015/)) and the diminishing burial space in London's cemeteries have made cremation the most popular choice of funeral care for London's residents ([cityoflondon.gov](http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/green-spaces/cemetery-and-crematorium/visitor-information/Pages/Frequently-asked-questions---Cremation.aspx)). Cremation unfortunately, is very energy demanding / inefficient and produces large amounts of noxious gases ([Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2005/oct/18/ethicalmoney.climatechange)), thus creating an opportunity area for people seeking a more sustainable and affordable funeral care service. *Pictured above is a model of the service's ceremonial coffin ('The Vessel').\n\n **'Pretium' is a sustainable funeral care service based on anaerobic digestion technology, for secular and/or environmentally conscious people living central London.**",

      title: "Design Development - The Coffin",
      description: "The coffin or ‘Vessel' has two important themes within its design; that it floats and that its a memento mori. The floating aspect is important as it creates a distance or detachment between the living and the dead during the funeral service. The memento mori aspect is a traditional motif that is subtly embedded with the design. Using the skull as a starting point, I exaggerated the central curves into abstraction.",
